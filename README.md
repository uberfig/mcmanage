# McManage

mcmanage is a dirt simple minecraft manager that allows for simple creation of minecraft servers and toggling them on and off through a nice web ui

currently only supports running one server at a time as we would need reverse proxy or some way to punch new firewall holes for servers which isn't great

todo: 
- [x] mojang api
- [x] downloading and running servers
- [x] web ui for creation and enable/disable servers
- [x] issue commands through the admin panel
- [ ] daily backups rotating weekly
- [ ] support for fabric servers 
- [ ] mod support
